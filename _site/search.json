    "text": "I am a Research Scholar in the Department of Statistics at Banaras Hindu University, where my research centers on developing robust statistical methods with strong real-world applicability. My primary focus is on statistical inference for lifetime models, particularly in the presence of censored data, as commonly encountered in survival analysis and reliability studies.\nMy work also delves into Bayesian methods, including Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques and Bayesian approximation methods, to develop adaptive and data-driven approaches to statistical inference. I am passionate about statistical computing, with a strong emphasis on open-source tools like R and LaTeX to ensure transparency and reproducibility in research.\nBeyond my theoretical work, I have a keen interest in R package development and R Shiny, exploring ways to create tools and interactive applications that enhance the accessibility and practical use of statistical methods in various fields.\nI am especially drawn to the interdisciplinary applications of statistics, aiming to develop methods that are not only theoretically rigorous but also practically impactful—across domains such as healthcare, engineering, and the social sciences.\nLearn more about me →\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
