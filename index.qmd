::: {#hero-heading}
I am an Adjunct Faculty in the [**Department of Mathematics, School of Basic and Applied Sciences (SoBAS) at Adamas University**](https://science.adamasuniversity.ac.in/mathematics/), where my research centers on developing robust statistical methods with strong real-world applicability. My primary focus is on **statistical inference for lifetime models**, particularly in the presence of **censored data**, as commonly encountered in survival analysis and reliability studies.

My work also delves into **Bayesian methods**, including **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques** and **Bayesian approximation methods**, to develop adaptive and data-driven approaches to statistical inference. I am passionate about statistical computing, with a strong emphasis on open-source tools like [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) to ensure transparency and reproducibility in research.

Beyond my theoretical work, I have a keen interest in **R package development** and [R Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/), exploring ways to create tools and interactive applications that enhance the accessibility and practical use of statistical methods in various fields.

I am especially drawn to the interdisciplinary applications of statistics, aiming to develop methods that are not only theoretically rigorous but also practically impactfulâ€”across domains such as healthcare, engineering, and the social sciences.
