::: {#hero-heading}
I am a researcher, R educator, and data journalist with a love for community. My **research** leverages electronic health record and spatial data to study the intersection of health equity and urban nature. My **journalism** and **community** projects value the partnership between open source tools and data literacy as a way to build power and effect change.
