# Personal Website for Debayan Koley
Welcome to the repository for my [personal website](https://kdeb.netlify.app), built with [R](https://rproject.org), [Quarto](quarto.org) and [Hugo Ap√©ro theme](https://hugo-apero-docs.netlify.app/). 

I have primarily followed the tips from [this blog](https://drganghe.github.io/quarto-academic-site-examples.html), but there are lots of useful articles and repositories available online on how to build a Quarto website from scratch.

Feel free to explore this repository for building your website using Quarto. I would also like to welcome any suggestions or comments on how to improve my webpage, as we are all learning together here.

Happy Coding! <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href='https://app.netlify.com/sites/kdeb/deploys'><img src='https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/892f29fa-9a43-4044-89ac-31a85d9801ab/deploy-status' align="right" height="20" alt='Netlify Status'/></a>
